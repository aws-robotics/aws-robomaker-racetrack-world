    from launch import LaunchDescription
    from launch.actions import IncludeLaunchDescription
    from launch.launch_description_sources import PythonLaunchDescriptionSource

# Load directly into Gazebo (without ROS)
```bash
export GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH=`pwd`/models
gazebo worlds/racetrack_day.world
```

# ROS Launch with Gazebo viewer (without a robot)
```bash
# build for ROS2
rosdep install --from-paths . --ignore-src -r -y
colcon build

# run in ROS2
source install/setup.sh
ros2 launch aws_robomaker_racetrack_world view_racetrack.launch.py
```

# Robot Simulation
A good initial robot position near the start line is (2.75, -15.00, 0.2).

# Building
Include this as a .rosinstall dependency in your SampleApplication simulation workspace and run the following commands:

```bash
$ rosws update
$ rosdep install --from-paths . --ignore-src -r -y
$ colcon build
```
